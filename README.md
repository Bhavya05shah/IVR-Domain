This repository contains the code to the BallBalancing at the centre of an axis and creating a custom environment for such

Custom Enviornment
<br>
Had been created with the help of this youtube vid:- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD6V3rcr_54&t=464s
and coded the specifics of environment with the help of Gymnasium library and atari games in it

RL Algorithm
<br>
The algorithm used here is DQN and Policy used is Mlp Policy , which i had studied from the Huggingface website , the basics and practice of ML were derived from Kaggle , used jypter notebook and VS Code for coding

Visulaisation
<br>
I have rendered the environment in text form with this-> '-' as the table and this-> '0' as the ball
