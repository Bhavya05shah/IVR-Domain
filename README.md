# IVR-Domain
This repository contains the code to the BallBalancing at the centre of an axis and creating a custom environment for such

Custom Enviornment
Had been created with the help of this youtube vid:- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD6V3rcr_54&t=464s
and coded the specifics of environment with the help of Gymnasium library and atari games in it

RL Algorithm
The algorithm used here is DQN and Policy used is Mlp Policy , which i had studied from the Huggingface website , the basics and practice of ML were derived from Kaggle , used jypter notebook and VS Code for coding

Visulaisation
I have rendered the environment in text form with this-> '-' as the table and this-> '0' as the ball
